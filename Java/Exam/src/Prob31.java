/*
A. Refer to the 'Student.txt' file provided with this exam. Integrate a command-line interface into your
program (from question 30) with a sole option:1 - Import from file. When this option is selected, a file
selection dialog should pop up (Hint: Consider using JFileChooser). Users can then pick the appropriate file
(defensive programming isn't mandatory, though appreciated). The program should read the file content line by line,
process it, and create corresponding student objects.Store these objects in an ArrayList.

B. Enhance the program
to showcase the student list. Users should have the capability to input student marks and determine the final grade.
It's your call on the program's user interaction design and the method of information presentation.
